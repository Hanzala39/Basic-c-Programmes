# ⭐ C++ Triangle Pattern Programs

This repository contains two simple **C++ console programs** that print star (`*`) patterns —  
a **left-aligned triangle** and a **right-aligned triangle**.  

These projects are great for beginners practicing **nested loops**, **output formatting**,  
and understanding how to control spaces and stars in console patterns.
