# ⭐ C++ Triangle Pattern Programs

This repository contains two simple **C++ console programs** that print star (`*`) patterns —  
a **left-aligned triangle** and a **right-aligned triangle**.  

These projects are great for beginners practicing **nested loops**, **output formatting**,  
and understanding how to control spaces and stars in console patterns.

## 📂 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `left_triangle.cpp` | Prints a left-aligned triangle pattern using `*`. |
| `right_triangle.cpp` | Prints a right-aligned triangle pattern using `*`. |

## 💻 Example Outputs

### Left-Aligned Triangle



Absolutely! For a GitHub repository, you **don’t need to upload `.exe` files** — usually just the source code (`.cpp`) and a `README.md` are enough. `.exe` files are platform-specific and increase repository size unnecessarily.

Here’s a **professional and clear `README.md`** template you can use:

# Star Pattern Generator in C++

This repository contains C++ programs to generate star patterns, including both **right-angle** and **left-angle** triangles.  

## Files

- `right_angle_pattern.cpp` – Prints a right-angled triangle of stars.
- `left_angle_pattern.cpp` – Prints a left-angled triangle of stars.

> Note: Only source files (`.cpp`) are included. Compiled executables (`.exe`) are not uploaded to keep the repository lightweight and cross-platform.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-patterns.git
````

2. Navigate to the folder:

```bash
cd star-patterns
```

3. Compile and run the program (example for right-angle triangle):

```bash
g++ right_angle_pattern.cpp -o right_angle_pattern
./right_angle_pattern
```

For left-angle triangle:
